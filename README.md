A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension.

This extension includes an auto-reply discussion feature, customizable max tokens, and permission controls who can use this feature.

This extension is a fixed fork from [flarum-chatgpt](https://github.com/datlechin/flarum-chatgpt) with support for multiple platforms. Currently supporting:
- OpenAI

Any model from these 2 platforms can be used.

The auto-answer feature uses the OpenAI gpt-5-mini model by default to generate quick and accurate responses to users' questions.
